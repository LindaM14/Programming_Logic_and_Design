# Create a variable with your name in.
# Use a for loop to print every letter of your name in uppercase, one letter per line.
# So if your name is Sam,
# name = 'sam'
# Your program would print
# S
# A
# M


# print name
name = 'LINDA'

# print all the letters in your name individually
for letter in name:
    print(letter)
